### Hi there 👋
I'm a Frontend Engineer and Product Designer currently based in Lagos, Nigeria.
I love to ideate and solve problems intuitively and simplistically end-to-end. I design, architect and develop sophitcated digital products in a way that is agile and scalable. Have any questions, proposals or something else, you can always reach out to me via email: philip.c.obosi@gmail.com

I am currently focused on creating high quality content around fundamental and advanced web development topics and concepts in the form of blogs, articles, talks and video tutorials.

You may find some of my articles on Scotch.io, LogRocket, and Twilio.

Previously, I architected and led frontend engineering efforts at Kudi Inc. where I contributed to an internal component design system as well as built several admin tools(dashboards and bots) for the smooth operation of the business.

Before Kudi, I founded Shopable ( a mobile app for selling on multiple social media platforms.).
